Problem:
After writing the LUT file, the USB slave task locks up.

Notes:
The ISR never fires again.
I can still control it with the HID device.
When locked up, udi_cdc_rx_start nor udi_cdc_data_received is called.
udi_cdc_rx_start tests:
UI has item by 8th call -> 7th call finished the get call.
15 calls before lockup
prvUSB_slave_Rx_Handler:
	2 hits after the UI element appears
	
	3 hits, then UI shows element
	5 hits, then stall
	

Write 3-byte file.  Success.
Delete 3-byte file.  Success.
Write 94-byte file.  Stall.
Restart.
Write 94-byte file.  Stall.
Restart.
Write 93-byte file.  Stall.
Restart.
Write 50-byte file.  Success.
Write 89-byte file.  Success.
Write 90-byte file.  Stall.

90 + 4 + 1 = 95 -> two packets.
Multiple write packets -> stall!!!!!!!!!

Issue has been resolves.  Problem:  The UI code would always write the bytes_to_send array length instead of the actual bytes to send, causing the system to send more bytes than APT was expecting.
