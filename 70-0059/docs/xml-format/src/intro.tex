\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to define how system-level XMLs are formatted.
After reading the document, developers will be able to write existing XMLs (system, structure, etc.) and
    to extend the existing XML parser in a cohesive fashion.

This document will \emph{not} detail how the XML directory is set up; see "README.md" in the XML directory.
